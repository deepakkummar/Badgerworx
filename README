If you are considering taking the coding test for Digi2al's 'Badgerworx' project, I must inform you that it may be a waste of time. This job has been posted for several months, and they have conducted numerous multi-round interviews without hiring anyone. Your time and energy might be better spent elsewhere. However, the decision is entirely yours if you choose to proceed with the process. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!
